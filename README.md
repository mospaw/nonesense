# nonsentences

A revival of Jeff Holman's nonsense generator. Original script: http://www.jholman.com/scripts/nonsense/

This project is still in very early development. In other words, the code isn't fully converted, optimized, or even pretty. There is redundant commented-out code, and other issues.

See `index.php` for an example of use.
